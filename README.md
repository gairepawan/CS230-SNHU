Repositories for the CS-230 Course Projects

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

To expand its customer base, Chat Away, a social media company, aims to create a mobile app version of its website that can be distributed on both Android and iPhone app stores. Keeping within budget and meeting the timeline are critical priorities for this project.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I effectively emphasized both the strengths and weaknesses of any possible solution.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It's always beneficial to explore a project to some extent. This involves outlining various possible directions and evaluating their impacts on the project. The challenge lies in determining when you've conducted sufficient exploration.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

When evaluating the essential platforms for the application's success, I overlooked some crucial aspects, particularly security. Emphasizing secure coding practices and other security measures should always be prioritized and not overlooked.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

If you fail to meet your users' needs, they will switch to another application as soon as a better option becomes available. Additionally, consistently delighting your users is essential for retaining even the most loyal ones.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

In software design, I start by listening to users through interviews and stories. I prototype early and refine designs based on their feedback, using Agile methods like Scrum for flexibility. Testing ensures usability, and clear documentation helps the team work together. I focus on security and scalability from the beginning. Looking ahead, I'll stick with these methods while learning new tech to improve how we make software.
